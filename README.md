# pong-game

My take on the pong game. There is one paddle on each 
side, and a ball, starting in the middle. If the ball
touches the paddle, it bounces in the opposite direction.
However, if the paddle misses the ball, then the ball is 
put in the middle, and moves in the opposite direction,
and giving a point to the opponent. The longer the round
lasts, the faster the ball gets.

right paddle movement: 
- 'up key' to move up
- 'down key' to move down

left paddle movement:
- 'w' to move up
- 's' to move down
